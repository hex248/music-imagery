Sweet Life is the 4th track from Frank Ocean’s first studio album ‘channel ORANGE’. It describes an individual who has never known anything other than wealth, and explores how they live their life, hence the title ‘Sweet Life’.

The first verse starts with “The best song wasn’t the single, but you weren’t either, Living in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills”. Here, Frank states that the subject of the song lives in Ladera Heights - an LA neighbourhood which is often referred to as the black Beverly Hills. This immediately gives the listener the impression that this song will be about luxury and wealth. He then goes on to describe it as “domesticated paradise” with “palm trees and pools”. Frank sets the scene of the track, describing a dream neighbourhood and goes on to describe the lifestyle of those living there. “Swallow the pill, keeping it surreal” suggests that those living in Ladera Heights may use their wealth to escape any of their problems, in the form of drug abuse. He then describes their freedom when he says “whatever you like, whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high”. The subject of this song has the luxury of escaping whatever troubles they face with their money, possibly demonstrating envy in Frank. This is supported when in the next line, he compares this person’s luxuries to his own possessions, “My TV ain’t HD, thats too real”. This gives the impression that Frank may be jealous of this person’s freedom and wealth. However, Frank then lists “grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes” and describes this as “the sweet life”. This demonstrates Frank’s more mature approach to life, where he is not blinded by his wealth and has chosen to value the natural luxuries of life. This introduces an interesting perspective to the music industry, where people often refer to materialistic possessions when talking about a “sweet life” or luxury in general.

The second verse of Sweet Life consists of frank repeating “sweet life, sweet life” as the instrumental builds up. The repetition of the phrase “sweet life” creates emphasis on what Frank believes to be the sweet life. This verse serves less as a storytelling device but more as a way to shed some light on the instrumental as it builds up from soft drums and a simple melody to a more grand composition. Different elements are added to the instrumental over the course of the second verse. This perfectly sets Frank up for the third verse.

Frank sings “you’ve had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born” once the instrumental has built up. Here, he states the privilege that the individual has, and has had “since [they] were born”. Again, this contrasts Frank’s perspective on “the sweet life”, where it is implied that the person Frank is singing about has grown up living what they may see as “the sweet life”. However, comparing this perspective with his own and talking from a place of understanding, Frank says “the star shine always kept you warm, so why see the world, when you got the beach?”. Frank understands the security that the “star shine” provides this person and uses the rhetorical question “so why see the world, when you got the beach?” to describe their lifestyle and mentality when it comes to how they wish to lead their life. He understands why this person is comfortable in their lifestyle and why it means that they are fine with not “[seeing] the world”.

Sweet Life is a song which explores themes of wealth and luxury while also telling the story of somebody who is aiming to understand a lifestyle different from their own. I believe that lots of people find it hard to understand different lifestyles and may look down on those who lead their lives in a different way and I think that Sweet Life challenges this idea and encourages people to do otherwise.
