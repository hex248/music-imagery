'Mr. Lonely' follows '911' in the two part song by Tyler, The Creator featuring Frank Ocean and Steve Lacy. It explores the unexpected and overlooked loneliness in those who are outgoing and successful. This idea is explored through 'Mr. Lonely', one of Tyler's many alter egos developed through his music.

The verse begins with “They say the loudest in the room is weak”, referencing Denzel Washington in 'American Gangster'. Tyler goes on to correct this quotation with “I say the loudest in the room is prolly the loneliest one in the room (That's me)”. Here, Tyler is referring to his boisterous personality which often makes him the centre of attention. Despite this attention, Tyler sees himself as the loneliest in the room, calling himself an “attention seeker”. He then continues to criticise himself with “so fuckin' lonely” and “such a fuckin' phony”, demonstrating that Tyler is very self-critical and harsh on himself.

Tyler says that “My heart is low, it's real low, it's so low, you can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo”, comparing his mental state to the doors of a Lamborghini Gallardo, one of the few models which lack butterfly doors. Tyler further degrades himself by comparing himself to materialistic items, suggesting that he feels lifeless and no longer human. This gives yet another glimpse into Tyler's mental state, creating a personal connection between the artist and its listener. “Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla” is a playful reference to Elon Musk's car crash which happened shortly before he invested in Tesla. Tyler then continues by directly addressing the listener, by saying “I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars, but what the fuck else do you want from me? That is the only thing keepin' me company”, suggesting that all he has gained from his success is his car collection along with other purchases he has made, not any real friends to keep him company. This acts as a reminder to the reader that 'money can't buy happiness' and that your financial success doesn't directly influence your mental state and often times, rising to fame can be a stressful and mentally straining process filled with novelty and confusion. Tyler suggests that the listener must be 'sick' of the car references which fill Flower Boy, as he too is sick of living a life filled with materialism. Tyler states that his purchases are “items fillin' the void” suggesting that these items are an attempt to recover from or make up for something, most likely resembling the character's loneliness. He then doubts his purchases, saying “I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy”.

Later in the verse, Tyler reflects on his loneliness and shares his confusion, stating that “I got the talent, the face and the funds”, wondering why he is lonely despite his possessions which aimed to solve this issue of loneliness. Tyler makes a reference to a scene from 'Snow White' with “Mirror, mirror on the wall (Who) The loneliest of them all (Me)”. This could suggest that Tyler sees Mr. Lonely as an antagonist and paints him in a bad light. Tyler could be using this as a possible reason as to why the character faces loneliness. Flower Boy contains many references to cupid, from See You Again, a story about a distant love interest, Tyler says that “Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision”, giving the impression that Tyler was quite literally struck by love. As Mr. Lonely tries to find reasons for his loneliness, he blames his misfortune on cupid, saying that he is “actin' stupid”. This presents a juxtaposition between Flower Boy's perspectives on cupid and love and represents the character's transition over the course of the album. Later in the album, Flower Boy sings about reminiscing and wanting to travel back in time in 'November' the 12th track of the playlist. This could suggest that the Flower Boy who becomes Mr. Lonely longs to go back to his old self who is portrayed in See You Again as someone who is full of love.

Finally, Mr. Lonely says “check in on me sometime, ask me how I'm really doin'”, as a final call for help and support.
